Diary Davis:

Work im progress:
    - [Lars] ls command


Schedule:

Thursday, 28.03.2024: - Lars & Mirco
Started with the presentation (PowerPoint) for the 04.04.2024. Worked on scheduling.

Thursday, 04.04.2024: - Mirco
Researched commands and utalization of gnuplot and experimented with it. Prepared plot for using it later.

Friday, 12.04.2024: Mirco
Prepared a LaTeX file for the report.

Today I worked on finishing our parsing algorithm in order to be able to execute commands properly.
Now our shell parses the input to some pattern as follows:
[First word] [every input word starting with "-" concatenated removing redunant "-"'s] [rest of words, ...]

Additionally, I implemented the "hist" command which displays the latest commands executed. For this command I added
the flags "-a" (all executed commands), "-t" (correctly executed commands) and "-f" (failed commands).
Where with the last two commands we see a maximum of five entries. Moreover I added some color to indicate,
whether a command was executed successfully or not. The data structure behind this command is a doubly linked list.
I made it double, in case we need it for future addons, such as traversing past commands using the arrow-keys on your keyboard.

Tuesday, 16.04.2024: Mirco
Achieved to make gnuplot work over the DAVIS-shell. It can now plot graphs with an input file from the users PC or the repository.
I will now work on a settings file and some flags, so the user can customize the graphs.
I reworked the history command and extended its functionalities. We now set a default amount of elements which are
getting printed. Moreover, I made it clearer on how you can use this command.

Today I seem to have fixed the issue, where you could not print out larger amount of ndoes. In order to fix that,
I added mutexlocks to regulate the access to the linked list itself, because there seem to be some intersecting usages
among our program.

Thursday, 18.04.2024: - Lars
I finalized the implementation of our embedded minigame 'Wordle'. Now it offeres the possibility to use hints to uncover
either a correct letter at a correct position, or a letter which is in the word, but not necessariliy at the correct position.
The usage of the hints is connected to the small amount of points. We set the amount to 200 and 130 respectively.
In order to gain points to be able to afford such a hint, is to firstly use the shell by executing commands or to play 'Wordle'.
Depending on how "complicated" the command is, you receive more points. But be aware, playing 'Wordle' is free :)

Today I managed to add shared memory into the command execution section of our shell. We are already showing the state
of a command's execution in our history, but not yet properly and correct for system commands such as piped ones or
commands which are not built ins. The concept now enables the child process to overwrite a shared memroy integer,
in case something goes south with any command. We do not care why something did not execute. It just simply did not execute,
therefore we set the variable accordingly. Moreover, I fixed some bugs.

Friday, 26.04.2024: Mirco
I tried solving the problem with the paths for the plotting. It will accept either a path or a function written directly (e.g. sin(x)).
I tried handling the error with stat() to see if it is a path or not, but it will always tell me that it is not. I experimented with
multiple diffrent inputs but still the same result.

Saturday 27.04.2024: Mirco
Replaced stat() with acceess() to check if path exists. But it doesn't work either. Researched further to find another way.

Monday 29.04.2024: Mirco
I finally achieved to check the paths correctly. We have three cases:
- a path without '' or "" -> print with '' to gnuplot
- a path with '' or with "" -> print as is to gnuplot
- a direct function/no existing path -> print as is to gnuplot
Now we have to decide which settings we want as default.

Wednesday 01.05.2024: Lars
I am still trying to figure out, why with "ls -a" the folder ".." is being displayed twice.
I seem to have introduced this bug after adding the readable flag to it and the formatting for the "-l".
Additionally, I did some research regarding registring special keystrokes such as the arrow keys, which we want,
to traverse the history in classical shell manner. This is going to be a bit of a rough patch, as it introduces new levels of problems,
which are multithreaded access to the standard input, which is not good. However, I am still working on that.

Thursday 02.05.2024: Lars
I fixed the bug I had with the double entry of "..". Although I do not know what I did. But somehow it resolved itself.
I was just doodeling around and fixed it. Life's great.

Friday 03.05.2024: Mirco
We decided on the following flags and arguments for the plot command:
flags:
-b → removes borders
-g → removes grid
-e → adds errorbars
-p → graph with points
-l -> graph with lines
-l & -p → graph with lines and points
-s → saves graph as png directly

arguments (after file/function argument)
title:someGraph
xlabel:speed
ylabel:distance
color:#ffffff → changes color of graph lines/points to hexa value
xr:[-2:2] → limits range of x-values to given input
yr:[-2:2] → limits range of y-values to given input
legend:ne/nw/se/sw → moves legend to different corner

potentially added later:
pt:7 → changes point type according to gnuplot legend
ps:2 → changes point size relatively to default size
lw:2 → changes line width relatively to default size

Monday 06.05.2024: Lars
Today I fixed the ls command to now support printing of other directories apart from the current one.

Tuesday 07.05.2024: Lars
I implemented the additional "-e" flag for the history command. With it we can now re-execute a previously executed command.
It seems to work after a couple of tests.

Tuesday 14.05.2024: Lars
Fixed a bug inside the parsing methods. Now commands using multiple flags are zeroterminated correctly.


Sunday 05.05.2024: Mirco
Now all arguments except the color argument work.
The color argument is not a 'set' command but has to be put after 'plot ...' so it has to be handled differetnly.
Most flags have to be handled like this so it should be easy to do them the same.

Tuesday 07.05.2024: Mirco
Implemented the flags and the color argument. Flag '-s' is still missing because I need to read into saving files a bit more.
There is still a problem: it prints out "invalid argument" when you have more then one string for the flags.
This is most likely because after concatinating the flags, the programm sees this as another empty argument.

Wednesday 08.05.2024: Mirco
Implemented darkmode and set it to default because it matches the theme of DAVIS more. Now I have to work on flag '-d' that can turn it off again.
