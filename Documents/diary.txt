Today I worked on finishing our parsing algorithm in order to be able to execute commands properly.
Now our shell parses the input to some pattern as follows:
[First word] [every input word starting with "-" concatenated removing redunant "-"'s] [rest of words, ...]

Additionally, I implemented the "hist" command which displays the latest commands executed. For this command I added
the flags "-a" (all executed commands), "-t" (correctly executed commands) and "-f" (failed commands).
Where with the last two commands we see a maximum of five entries. Moreover I added some color to indicate,
whether a command was executed successfully or not. The data structure behind this command is a doubly linked list.
I made it double, in case we need it for future addons, such as traversing past commands using the arrow-keys on your keyboard.

I reworked the history command and extended its functionalities. We now set a default amount of elements which are
getting printed. Moreover, I made it clearer on how you can use this command.

Today I seem to have fixed the issue, where you could not print out larger amount of ndoes. In order to fix that,
I added mutexlocks to regulate the access to the linked list itself, because there seem to be some intersecting usages
among our program.

I finalized the implementation of our embedded minigame 'Wordle'. Now it offeres the possibility to use hints to uncover
either a correct letter at a correct position, or a letter which is in the word, but not necessariliy at the correct position.
The usage of the hints is connected to the small amount of points. We set the amount to 200 and 130 respectively.
In order to gain points to be able to afford such a hint, is to firstly use the shell by executing commands or to play 'Wordle'.
Depending on how "complicated" the command is, you receive more points. But be aware, playing 'Wordle' is free :)

Today I managed to add shared memory into the command execution section of our shell. We are already showing the state
of a command's execution in our history, but not yet properly and correct for system commands such as piped ones or
commands which are not built ins. The concept now enables the child process to overwrite a shared memroy integer,
in case something goes south with any command. We do not care why something did not execute. It just simply did not execute,
therefore we set the variable accordingly.
