Today I worked on finishing our parsing algorithm in order to be able to execute commands properly.
Now our shell parses the input to some pattern as follows:
[First word] [every input word starting with "-" concatenated removing redunant "-"'s] [rest of words, ...]

Additionally I implemented the "hist" command which displays the latest commands executed. For this command I added
the flags "-a" (all executed commands), "-t" (correctly executed commands) and "-f" (failed commands).
Where with the last two commands we see a maximum of five entries. Moreover I added some color to indicate,
whether a command was executed successfully or not. The data structure behind this command is a doubly linked list.
I made it double, in case we need ii for future addons, such as traversing past commands using the arrow-keys on your keyboard.
